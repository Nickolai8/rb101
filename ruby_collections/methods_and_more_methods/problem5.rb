# shift on a hash removes a key:value pair from it and returns it as a
# two item array [k, v]. This method is destructive. If there is nothing
# in the hash object that shift is called on, it will return the hash's
# default value. Therefore, this code will return the array
# [:a, 'ant'].
# As usual, if we ever need help understanding a method, we can either
# read the documentation or experiment with snippets of code ourselves.
