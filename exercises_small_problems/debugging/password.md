The issue with this code is that the local variable `password` scoped to the main method cannot be reassigned from within a method definition, so the `set_password` method does nothing that it was intended to. One could replace `line 22`, which is currently a method invocation for the `set_password` method only to `password = set_password` since the `set_password` method returns the value assigned to the `password` local variable scoped to the method `set_password`. 

Even after accounting for this, there is still an error. The `verify_password` method is invoked on the last line of code. The `verify_password` method definition attempts to reference the local variable `password` scoped to the main method. The methods scope does not have access to local variables scoped to the main method. To be able to use the value that the local variable `password` references in the `verify_password` method, we should define the method in a way that allows us to pass in `password` as an argument to the method invocation, like such:

````ruby
password = nil

def set_password
  puts 'What would you like your password to be?'
  new_password = gets.chomp
  password = new_password
end

def verify_password(password)
  puts '** Login **'
  print 'Password: '
  input = gets.chomp

  if input == password
    puts 'Welcome to the inside!'
  else
    puts 'Authentication failed.'
  end
end

if !password
  set_password
end

verify_password(password)
